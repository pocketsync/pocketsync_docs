### Basic setup

1. Create a project in the [PocketSync console](https://pocketsync.dev)
2. Initialize PocketSync in your app:

```dart
import 'package:pocketsync_flutter/pocketsync_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  final dbPath = join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'my_app.db');
  
  try {
    await PocketSync.initialize(
      dbPath: dbPath,
      options: PocketSyncOptions(
        projectId: 'your-project-id',
        authToken: 'your-auth-token',
        serverUrl: 'https://api.pocketsync.dev',
      ),
      databaseOptions: databaseOptions,
    );

    await PocketSync.instance.setUserId(userId: 'user-123');
    await PocketSync.instance.start();
  } catch (e) {
    print('Failed to initialize PocketSync: $e');
  }
}
```

## Configuration

PocketSync can be configured with various options to customize its behavior. The `PocketSyncOptions` class accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `projectId` | Your project ID from the PocketSync dashboard | Required |
| `authToken` | Authentication token from the PocketSync dashboard | Required |
| `serverUrl` | PocketSync server URL | `https://api.pocketsync.dev` |
| `changeLogRetentionDays` | Number of days to retain change logs | 30 |
| `syncExistingData` | Whether to sync existing data | `true` |
| `conflictResolutionStrategy` | Strategy for resolving conflicts | `lastWriteWins` |
| `customResolver` | Custom conflict resolver function | `null` |
| `verbose` | Enable detailed logging | `false` |

Example configuration with custom options:

```dart
final options = PocketSyncOptions(
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  authToken: 'your-auth-token',
  serverUrl: 'https://api.pocketsync.dev',
  changeLogRetentionDays: 60,
  syncExistingData: true,
  conflictResolutionStrategy: ConflictResolutionStrategy.custom,
  customResolver: (localChange, remoteChange) {
    // Your custom conflict resolution logic
    return localChange;
  },
  verbose: true,
);
```

## Start sync

- Call `PocketSync.instance.start()` to start the sync process.
- Call `PocketSync.instance.stop()` to stop the sync process.
- Make sure to call `PocketSync.instance.setUserId(userId: 'user-123')` before starting the sync process. This is required to identify the user and track their changes.

### Device id generation

PocketSync will automatically generate a unique device identifier for your app. This identifier is used to track changes made by the user on this device. There are some known limitations with device id generation on iOS:
- If the app is uninstalled and reinstalled, the device id will change.
- If the app is deleted and reinstalled, the device id will change.
- If the app is deleted and reinstalled, the device id will change.
