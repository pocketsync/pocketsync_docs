## Common issues and solutions

### Connection issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot connect to PocketSync server">
    **Symptoms**: 
    - Sync operations fail with network errors
    - App shows offline status even when online
    
    **Possible causes**:
    - Invalid server URL
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Server is down or unreachable
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Verify your server URL in the PocketSyncOptions
    2. Check your device's network connection
    3. Verify that your auth token is valid
    4. Check the PocketSync status page for any outages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication failures">
    **Symptoms**:
    - Sync operations fail with 401 or 403 errors
    - Cannot initialize PocketSync
    
    **Possible causes**:
    - Invalid or expired auth token
    - Invalid project ID
    - User ID not set before starting sync
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Verify your auth token and project ID in the PocketSync console
    2. Ensure you've called `setUserId()` before starting sync
    3. Check if your token has the necessary permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sync starts but no data is transferred">
    **Symptoms**:
    - PocketSync initializes without errors
    - No data is synchronized between devices
    
    **Possible causes**:
    - Incorrect table configuration
    - Data doesn't meet sync criteria
    - Sync process is stopped or paused
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Verify that your tables are properly configured for sync
    2. Check if `PocketSync.instance.start()` was called
    3. Inspect logs with verbose mode enabled
    4. Verify that data changes are being detected
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Synchronization Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data conflicts not resolving correctly">
    **Symptoms**:
    - Unexpected data values after sync
    - Different data appears on different devices
    
    **Possible causes**:
    - Conflict resolution strategy not appropriate for your use case
    - Custom resolver function has bugs
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Review your conflict resolution strategy
    2. Test your custom resolver with different conflict scenarios
    3. Consider using a different built-in strategy
    4. Enable verbose logging to see conflict details
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data loss during synchronization">
    **Symptoms**:
    - Records disappear after sync
    - Fields are reset to default values
    
    **Possible causes**:
    - Improper conflict resolution
    - Database schema mismatch
    - Incorrect data types
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Verify schema consistency across devices
    2. Check for proper data type handling
    3. Implement a custom conflict resolver that preserves data
    4. Restore from backup if available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sync is slow or consuming excessive resources">
    **Symptoms**:
    - Sync operations take a long time
    - High battery or network usage
    
    **Possible causes**:
    - Large dataset
    - Frequent changes triggering many sync operations
    - Inefficient change tracking
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Adjust sync frequency and debounce settings
    2. Optimize database queries and change detection
    3. Consider syncing only essential data
    4. Implement data pagination or chunking for large datasets
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging tips

### Enable verbose logging

Enable detailed logging to help diagnose issues:

```dart
final options = PocketSyncOptions(
  // ... other options
  verbose: true,
);
```

### Inspect database

Directly inspect the database to verify data integrity:

```dart
final db = PocketSync.instance.database;
final records = await db.query('your_table');
print('Records: $records');
```

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I reset sync state if things go wrong?">
    If you need to reset the sync state, you can use the `resetChangeTracking` method:
    
    ```dart
    await PocketSync.instance.resetChangeTracking();
    ```
    
    This will clear all pending changes and reset the sync state. Note that this won't delete your data, just the sync metadata.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if a device is offline for an extended period?">
    PocketSync is designed to handle extended offline periods. When a device comes back online, it will:
    
    1. Upload any local changes that occurred while offline
    2. Download remote changes that occurred during the offline period
    3. Resolve any conflicts according to your configured strategy
    
    For very long offline periods (weeks/months), you might want to consider a full resync by calling `resetChangeTracking()` followed by `start()`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I verify that sync is working correctly?">
    To verify sync is working:
    
    1. Enable verbose logging
    2. Make changes on one device and check that they appear on another
    3. Monitor the sync status using the `syncStatus` stream
    4. Check the server logs in the PocketSync console
    
    You can also implement a simple UI indicator to show sync status to users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I sync only specific tables or records?">
    Yes, you can configure which tables to sync when initializing PocketSync:
    
    ```dart
    final databaseOptions = PocketSyncDatabaseOptions(
      tables: [
        TableDefinition(
          name: 'todos',
          syncEnabled: true,
          // other options
        ),
        TableDefinition(
          name: 'settings',
          syncEnabled: false, // This table won't sync
          // other options
        ),
      ],
    );
    ```
    
    For more granular control, you can implement custom logic to determine which records to sync.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle schema migrations with PocketSync?">
    When changing your database schema:
    
    1. Update your table definitions
    2. Increment your database version
    3. Provide migration scripts
    
    ```dart
    final databaseOptions = PocketSyncDatabaseOptions(
      version: 2, // Increment this when schema changes
      onUpgrade: (db, oldVersion, newVersion) async {
        if (oldVersion == 1 && newVersion == 2) {
          await db.execute('ALTER TABLE todos ADD COLUMN priority INTEGER');
        }
      },
      // other options
    );
    ```
    
    Always test migrations thoroughly before deploying to production.
