## How PocketSync works

PocketSync is a lightweight, event-driven synchronization engine designed specifically for SQLite databases. It efficiently tracks changes, synchronizes data across devices, and ensures consistency even in offline scenarios.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Automatic change tracking

PocketSync automatically monitors your database for changes:
- No manual tracking required
- Seamless integration with existing SQLite databases
- Close to zero impact on your application's performance

#### 2. Real-time synchronization

Changes are synchronized in real-time across devices:
- Instant propagation to online devices
- Automatic queuing for offline devices
- Efficient delta-based updates

#### 3. Offline-First Design

Your application works seamlessly offline:
- Full functionality without network connection
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Smooth reconnection handling

### Usage Patterns

#### 1. Local-First operations

All operations are performed locally first:
- Immediate response times
- No waiting for server confirmation
- Reliable operation in any network condition

#### 2. Background synchronization

Sync happens automatically in the background:
- No manual sync required
- Efficient bandwidth usage
- Battery-friendly operation

#### 3. Conflict management

Conflicts are handled automatically:
- Configurable resolution strategies
- Predictable outcomes
- Optional manual resolution

### Best practices

#### 1. Data modeling

- Use appropriate primary keys
- Consider relationships carefully
- Plan for concurrent modifications

#### 2. Transaction management

- Group related changes
- Maintain data consistency
- Use appropriate isolation levels

#### 3. Network considerations

- Handle intermittent connectivity
- Implement retry strategies
- Monitor sync status

### Getting started

1. Initialize PocketSync with your database
2. Define your sync configuration
3. Start the sync engine
4. Monitor sync status as needed
