## Understanding offline-first

Offline-first is an approach to application development that prioritizes the offline experience, ensuring your app works seamlessly regardless of network connectivity. PocketSync is built with offline-first principles at its core.

### Key Principles

## Testing offline capabilities

### Manual testing

1. **Airplane mode test**: Toggle airplane mode on and off to simulate connectivity changes and verify data syncs when connection is restored
2. **Slow network test**: Use network throttling tools to simulate poor connectivity and ensure the app remains responsive
3. **Extended offline test**: Keep the app offline for several days, make multiple changes, then reconnect to verify all changes synchronize properly

## Best practices

Building offline-first applications with PocketSync enables your users to have a seamless experience regardless of network conditions. By implementing these best practices, you can create applications that are resilient, responsive, and user-friendly:

1. **Design for offline first**: Assume users will frequently be offline and design your app's workflow accordingly
2. **Implement optimistic UI**: Update the interface immediately without waiting for server confirmation
3. **Handle conflicts intelligently**: Choose appropriate conflict resolution strategies for different data types
4. **Test thoroughly**: Simulate various network conditions to ensure your app functions reliably in all scenarios
