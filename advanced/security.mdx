## Security

### Authentication

PocketSync uses a simple authentication system based on a project ID and an authentication token. The project ID is used to identify the project, and the authentication token is used to authenticate the user.

The authentication token is generated in the PocketSync console and can be found in the integrations tab.

### Security

PocketSync is a secure service that provides a simple and efficient way to store and sync data across devices. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.

### How data is stored

PocketSync stores data in a Postgres database. Data stored are your own, we are working to provide you a simple way to export your data. We also plan to provide a self-hosted version of PocketSync in the future.
