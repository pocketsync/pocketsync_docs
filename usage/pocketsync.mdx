# PocketSync

PocketSync is the main orchestrator of all synchronization operations. It exposes a singleton object `PocketSync.instance` that manages initialization, user authentication, and sync control.

## Overview

PocketSync follows a simple lifecycle:
1. Initialize the sync engine
2. Authenticate users
3. Control sync operations (start/pause)
4. Clean up resources when done

## Initialization

Before using PocketSync, you need to initialize it with your project configuration:

```dart
await PocketSync.initialize(
  dbPath: path,
  options: PocketSyncOptions(
    projectId: 'your-project-id',
    authToken: 'your-auth-token',
    serverUrl: 'https://api.pocketsync.dev',
  ),
  databaseOptions: DatabaseOptions(
    onCreate: (db, version) async {
      // Define your database schema
      await db.execute(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_table(...)',
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

### Parameters

- `dbPath`: Path to your SQLite database file
- `options`: PocketSync configuration options
  - `projectId`: Your project ID from the PocketSync console
  - `authToken`: Your project's authentication token
  - `serverUrl`: PocketSync server URL (defaults to https://api.pocketsync.dev)
  - `conflictResolver`: Custom conflict resolution strategy (defaults to applying remote changes)
  - `silent`: Whether to suppress console logs (defaults to true in release mode, false in debug mode)
- `databaseOptions`: SQLite database configuration
  - `onCreate`: Required callback to create your database schema
  - `version`: Database schema version number (defaults to 1)
  - `onConfigure`: Optional callback for database configuration before creation/opening
  - `onUpgrade`: Optional callback for handling database schema upgrades
  - `onDowngrade`: Optional callback for handling database schema downgrades
  - `onOpen`: Optional callback triggered after database is opened

## User authentication

After initialization, you need to set a user ID to identify the current device's owner:

```dart
await PocketSync.instance.setUserId(userId: 'user-123');
```

This step is crucial for:
- Identifying which user's data to sync
- Managing access control
- Tracking changes per user

## Controlling sync operations

### Starting sync

To begin synchronizing data:

```dart
await PocketSync.instance.start();
```

This will:
- Connect to the PocketSync server
- Upload local changes
- Download remote changes
- Keep data in sync across devices

### Pausing sync

To temporarily pause synchronization:

```dart
PocketSync.instance.pause();
```

This is useful when you want to:
- Conserve battery/network usage
- Perform large batch operations
- Prevent immediate sync during sensitive operations

## Resource cleanup

When you're done with PocketSync (e.g., user logs out), properly dispose of resources:

```dart
await PocketSync.instance.dispose();
```

This will:
- Stop all sync operations
- Close database connections
- Clean up memory resources
- Disconnect from the server

## Best practices

1. **Initialize early**: Call `initialize()` as early as possible in your app's lifecycle, typically in `main()`

2. **Handle errors**: Wrap PocketSync operations in try-catch blocks:
```dart
try {
  await PocketSync.initialize(...);
  await PocketSync.instance.setUserId(userId: 'user-123');
  await PocketSync.instance.start();
} catch (e) {
  print('PocketSync error: $e');
}
```

3. **Cleanup resources**: Always call `dispose()` when cleaning up your app or logging out users

4. **User Management**: Update the user ID whenever the authenticated user changes

## Example implementation

Here's a complete example showing proper PocketSync usage:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  final dbPath = join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'my_app.db');
  
  try {
    // Initialize PocketSync
    await PocketSync.initialize(
      dbPath: dbPath,
      options: PocketSyncOptions(
        projectId: 'your-project-id',
        authToken: 'your-auth-token',
        serverUrl: 'https://api.pocketsync.dev',
      ),
      databaseOptions: DatabaseOptions(
        onCreate: (db, version) async {
          await db.execute(
            'CREATE TABLE items(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)',
          );
        },
      ),
    );

    // Set user ID
    await PocketSync.instance.setUserId(userId: 'user-123');
    
    // Start syncing
    await PocketSync.instance.start();
    
    runApp(MyApp());
  } catch (e) {
    print('Failed to initialize PocketSync: $e');
  }
}

// In your app's cleanup/logout logic:
void cleanup() async {
  await PocketSync.instance.dispose();
}
```
